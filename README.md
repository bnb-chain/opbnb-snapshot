## Usage

### Step 1: Download the snapshot and decompress it.

```bash
wget -q -O - https://opbnb-snapshot-testnet.bnbchain.org/geth-20240418.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
```

### Step 2: Replace the data.

1. Stop the running `op-geth` client, ensuring that it has completely shut down.
2. To back up the original data, execute the following commands:
    ```
    mv ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/chaindata ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/chaindata_backup
    mv ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/triecache ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/triecache_backup
    ```
3. Replace the data with the snapshot by running:
    ```
    mv ./geth/chaindata ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/chaindata
    mv ./geth/triecache ${OPGeth_DataDir}/geth/triecache
    ```
4. Restart the `op-geth` client and verify the logs.
